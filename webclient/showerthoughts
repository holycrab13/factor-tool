bind criteria while searching?

SELECT ?s0 ?c0 ?c1 ?c2 ?c3 ?c4...

?s1 ?p (resourceA) BIND(?c1a -> ?p) BIND(?c1b -> (resourceA))
?s2 ?p (resourceB) BIND(?c2a -> ?p) BIND(?c2b -> (resourceA))
?s3 a (class) BIND(?c3a -> "is a"}... 
}}

pros: probably faster (no tracing)
cons: criteria only in text form (can be eliminated with 2 binds)
